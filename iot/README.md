##  Overview

Saka Stethoscope is an IoT-enabled digital stethoscope designed for heart sound monitoring and RHD (Rheumatic Heart Disease) screening. It captures heart sounds, processes them with a 20-400 Hz bandpass filter, and streams the data via BLE and WebSocket for real-time analysis.

##  Features

- **20-400 Hz Bandpass Filter** - Optimized for heart sound frequencies
- **Real-time Audio Processing** - 4kHz sampling rate with I2S
- **Dual Connectivity** - BLE and WebSocket (WiFi) streaming
- **WebSocket Server** - Stream audio to web clients in real-time
- **BLE Audio Streaming** - Connect to mobile apps
- **LED Status Indicators** - Power, WiFi, BLE, Audio activity
- **ESP32-based** - Low power, compact design
- **JSON Commands** - Control via WebSocket API
